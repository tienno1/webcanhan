            <h3>My love of nature</h3>
            <p><strong>A. Sarah</strong> When I was a child at school, I collected books about nature. My classmates and friends all spent their free time playing computer games, so to them I suppose I was a bit strange. I loved learning about animals from other countries, but as I got older I found out that my own country has interesting nature too, and that's what I like studying now. I do lots of drawings of nature, and I put them on my blog.</p>
            <p><strong>B. Pilar</strong> I love birds and animals because of all the visits to forests and lakes we made when I was at school. It's a shame that things have changed so much now. In my opinion, children these days don't learn enough about nature, so lots of them are afraid of insects, for example. I have a great job because of my love of nature. I'm a nature photographer. It's brilliant, except for the early mornings!</p>
            <p><strong>C. Lia</strong> A few years ago I read a blog with beautiful photos of animals, birds and plants, which made me start really looking at what lives around us. It was just a hobby at first, but now it's my job as I visit schools and give talks about nature. I love it. The only problem is if I am asked to draw a picture. I enjoy it, but I'm terrible at drawing! I'm going to take some lessons to try to get better.</p>

            <h3>LEARNING TO SAVE MONEY</h3>
            <p>by Sandy Castro, age 13</p>
            <p>Last March I lost my camera while I was on a school trip to Portsmouth. I left it on the bus on our way back to our school. I called the bus company the day after to check if they could find it, but of course it wasn't there. My parents got really angry and told me they couldn't buy me a new one.</p>
            <p>I knew my parents were right, so I decided I would get a new one by myself. I started thinking of ways to earn and save money. My parents give me £8 every week so the first thing I did was to keep my pocket money in a drawer in my bedroom.</p>
            <p>I also offered to help my uncle Alan. He's often away for work, but he can't take his dog with him. I started to look after his dog when he wasn't at home. After some time, my uncle's neighbors saw me. They asked me if I could help with their cats, dogs and rabbits, too. So, I started working, for three families living across the street.</p>
            <p>In less than three months I had enough money to buy a camera. It was the same as the one I had lost but to me it was much better. I paid for it with what I earned and it felt very different. This experience taught me what it means to work hard and I learnt that you must be careful with the things you have because they take a lot of hard work.</p>
