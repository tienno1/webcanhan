            <h3>Three travellers talking about their holidays.</h3>
            <h4>Max</h4>
            <p>I travelled to Bangkok in Thailand with some friends. The flight was long, but we found a cheap deal online. But then, it took two hours by bus to get to the hotel - I didn't enjoy that! The hotel was great though, with a huge swimming pool, and the best thing was, we spent almost nothing once we arrived! We mostly ate delicious, cheap street food, and stayed in the air-conditioned rooms at the hotel to escape the heat at night, but it was hard to sleep with such high temperatures, even with the air conditioning on.</p>
            <h4>Felipe</h4>
            <p>I went to a small town in southern France for two weeks with my family. The people who worked there were wonderful - they were so friendly and helpful, and they taught me some French! I wasn't so sure about the hotel restaurant - the desserts were fine, but the main courses weren't very good. It was much better in the town, where there were lots of lovely restaurants and cafes. It was so hot that we spent most of our time in the hotel swimming pool. I spent ages reading my book by the pool, and it was so relaxing.</p>
            <h4>Nikhil</h4>
            <p>My family and I visited some relatives in India, which was fantastic. I couldn't believe the differences in what people ate from place to place - we tried so many interesting dishes! It was good to be with the family, because there was always someone to talk to, or to do things with. The local buses were really cheap and comfortable, but they were often late. So we usually took taxis, which were more expensive, but much faster. We often spent the mornings by the beach, and in the afternoons we went for walks in the hills.</p>

            <h3>James is talking about his life in South Korea.</h3>
            <p>I’m James and I’m 16 years old. I live in South Korea with my parents and my younger sister. His parents moved there with the whole family five years ago. I love it here and I’ve got lots of friends.</p>
            <p>I started playing Go when I was 11. It’s a very popular game here. I used to go to a club after school to play Go with other children. Luckily the PE teacher is fantastic player she taught us at lunch time. I wasn’t very good at first, but I really enjoyed it.</p>
            <p>The best thing is meeting lots of lovely people. We have loads of fun together. I've played in competitions and sometimes win. But I prefer spending time with my friends, and that's why I go to the club. Some of my friends are really good players, but I don’t mind. We have a good time anyway.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy watching films. I prefer the funny stuff. If it doesn't make me laugh, I'm not interested. I enjoy watching sports too. I love watching basketball on TV, but I don’t often play it.</p>
            <p>I've got an important exam soon, so I need to spend a lot of time studying. It’s a bit boring, but I want to do well. After that, I'm going to travel and see some of the world. The one thing he knows for sure is that he'll never stop enjoying the game.</p>

            <h3>Better ways to travel</h3>
            <p>Travelling by car is fast and comfortable, but not **good** for the world around us. In fact, it makes a lot of pollution. Many countries are trying to find **better** ways for people to travel. One possibility is to **share** car journeys. For example, if you have neighbours who need to travel to the same **place** as you, you could go together. This means there would be fewer cars **making** the same journey. Another good idea is to use public transport more often, for example, travel by bus, tram or train, **especially** in a town or city. You can also walk or cycle more often, **instead** of driving. You'll get fit and **save** money too!</p>
