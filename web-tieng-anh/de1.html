            <h3>My last holiday</h3>
            <p><strong>A. Max</strong> I went on holiday with my friends. The flight was fine, but it took two hours by bus to get to the hotel - I didn't enjoy that! The hotel was noisy and the staff  weren't friendly, but it didn't matter because we spent all our time on the beach, a short walk away. We tried lots of new dishes in the restaurants in the town. It was hard to sleep with such high temperatures, but we had a fantastic time, and the best thing was, we spent almost nothing once we arrived!</p>
            <p><strong>B. Felipe</strong> The drive to our hotel from the airport was along lovely country roads. The hotel my wife and I stayed in was quite expensive. The people who worked there were wonderful, but I wasn't so sure about the hotel restaurant the desserts were fine, but the main courses weren't very good. It was cloudy and rainy most days, but it 	didn't matter at all because we went to walk in the countryside, not to lie on a beach.</p>
            <p><strong>C. Nikhil</strong> My family and I drove across the USA last year. We stayed in lots of different hotels. I don't know how much we spent because my parents paid. There was a lot of driving, but my dad enjoyed that. The weather was fantastic, and I couldn't believe the differences in what people ate from place to place. It was good to be 	with the family, because there was always someone to talk to, or to do things with</p>

            <h3>Teenage Go Player</h3>
            <p>by Sandy Castro, age 13</p>
            <p>James Kwak is a Go player. He has lived in South Korea since he was eight years old. His parents moved there with the whole family five years ago. Now, at the age of 13, many people think James could become one of the best Go player in the world.</p>
            <p>James' mother is a good Go player, but James didn't learn until he was seven. "Some of my friends wanted to join the local Go club even though none of them knew how to play!" he says. 'Luckily the PE teacher is fantastic player she taught us at lunch time."</p>
            <p>James loves to win competitions. In fact, he's made quite a lot of money, but that's not the most important thing to him. He travels around the world, too, nut he says that can be tiring. "The best thing is meeting lots of lovely people. We have loads of fun together."</p>
            <p>In his free time, James loves watching TV because he doesn't have to think! "My friends like pop and rock videos, or superhero movies. I prefer the funny stuff. If it doesn't make me laugh, I'm not interested"</p>
            <p>He's not sure about what he'll do in the future. 'I don't think I will be the world's number-one player,' he says. "But who knows?" He's thinking about going to university and studying to be a doctor. The one thing he knows for sure is that he'll never stop enjoying the game.</p>
            <p>Best of luck, James!</p>
